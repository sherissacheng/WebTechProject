        I'm an avid reader; I started in elementary school with popular fantasy
        series like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, and have since then moved
        into more realistic themes. However, magical realism holds a near spot
        to my heart, as it combines both the quirky and fun bits of fantasy
        while still staying grounded. Listed below are different tables
        representing my thoughts on books I have read.

            heads - at least that's where I imagine it - there's a little room
            where we store those memories. A room like the stacks in this
            library. And to understand the workings of our own heart we have to
            keep making new reference cards. We have to dust things off every
            once in a while, let in fresh air, change the water in the flower
            vases. In other words, you'll live forever in your own private
            library."
