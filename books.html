          I'm an avid reader; I started in elementary school with popular
          fantasy series such as Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, and have since
          then moved into more realistic themes. However, magical realism holds
          a near spot to my heart, as it combines both the quirky and fun bits
          of fantasy while still staying grounded. Listed below are different
          tables representing my thoughts on books I have read.

              our heads - at least that's where I imagine it - there's a little
              room where we store those memories. A room like the stacks in this
              library. And to understand the workings of our own heart we have
              to keep making new reference cards. We have to dust things off
              every once in a while, let in fresh air, change the water in the
              flower vases. In other words, you'll live forever in your own
              private library"
