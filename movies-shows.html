          <h2>Fallen Angels <br />by Wong Kar-wai</h2>
          <p>
            Fallen Angels is the second movie of Wong Kar-wai's I've watched and
            definitely sits near the top of my list of movies I've enjoyed. I
            particularly liked He Zhiwu: though mute, his actions are hilarious
            yet thoughtful, and he shows a lot of personality throughout the
            movie. I love how Cantonese wasn't the only spoken language; the
            Mandarin provided by He Zhiwu kept the dialogue fresh and
            interesting. I enjoyed seeing each character's position in life,
            though I did feel that they were hardly connected until the end.

          <h2>Howl's Moving Castle <br />by Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
          <p>
            Howl's Moving Castle is the first and only Studio Ghibli movie I've
            seen so far (which is truly a crime, I definitely need to watch more
            of them!). I love Miyazaki's world-building: every character is so
            unique in both personality and physical characteristics. The movie
            felt like a dream - I couldn't have predicted what Miyazaki would do
            next. Sophie and Howl are so sweet, and I love Calcifer!

          <h2>Dead Poets Society <br />by Peter Weir</h2>
          <p>
            Dead Poets Society is a Dark Academia dream: the romanticisation of
            school, the secret meetings to shout poetry and inspire others with
            words, and the honors society. Like the name suggests, there is a
            dark side to all of this, and Dead Poets Society is no different.
            This movie left me with a lot of inspiring quotes, and I
            particularly loved Neil.

          <h2>Merlin <br />by Julie Gardner</h2>
          <p>
            For a TV show that was produced in 2008, I think the quality isn't
            too bad. I'm sure I would cringe looking back at it now, but for
            middle-school me this show was hilarious and magical. The fact that
            I still remember how this show ended speaks to my dissatisfaction
            with it though. I miss Arthur and Merlin's banter.

          <h2>Queen's Gambit <br />by Scott Frank</h2>
          <p>
            As someone who was in the chess club in elementary school, and have
            since casually played, Queen's Gambit was very fun watch. I adore
            Beth's awkwardness around people and how it all disappears the
            moment she sits in front of a chess board. Her ambition is
            admirable, and I found it really interesting how Netflix tied in
            drug addiction with chess.

          <h2>Attack on Titan <br />by Hajime Isayama</h2>
          <p>
            I feel like Attack on Titan is a given for anyone who watches anime.
            The plot is so beautifully written and connected, and there were so
            many plot twists that I didn't expect at all in the moment, but
            looking back was able to find the little hints everywhere. Every
            character has so much development - Attack on Titan is truly a work
            of art and is definitely one of my favorite shows of all time.

          <h2>Haikyu!! <br />by Haruichi Furadate</h2>
          <p>
            Haikyu!! was the first ever anime I watched, so it definitely holds
            a special place in my heart. Hinata and Kageyama's dynamic is so
            fun, and while there are intense moments in the show, it feels
            lighthearted as whole. Whenever I feel nostalgic, I pull up Haikyu!!
            My favorite character is Akaashi, he's such a calm character and he 
            balances out Bokuto's energy.
