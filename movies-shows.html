          <h2>Fallen Angels <br />by Wong Kar-wai</h2>
          <p id="fa-text">
            Fallen Angels is the second movie of Wong Kar-wai's I've watched and
            definitely sits near the top of my list of movies I've enjoyed. I
            particularly liked He Zhiwu: though mute, his actions are hilarious
            yet thoughtful, and he shows a lot of personality throughout the
            movie. I love how Cantonese wasn't the only spoken language; the
            Mandarin provided by He Zhiwu kept the dialogue fresh and
            interesting. I enjoyed seeing each character's position in life,
            though I did feel that they were hardly connected until the end.

          <h2>Howl's Moving Castle <br />by Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
          <p id="hmc-text">
            Howl's Moving Castle is the first and only Studio Ghibli movie I've
            seen so far (which is truly a crime, I definitely need to watch more
            of them!). I love Miyazaki's world-building: every character is so
            unique in both personality and physical characteristics. The movie
            felt like a dream - I couldn't have predicted what Miyazaki would do
            next. Sophie and Howl are so sweet, and I love Calcifer!

          <h2>Dead Poets Society <br />by Peter Weir</h2>
          <p id="dps-text">
            Dead Poets Society is a Dark Academia dream: the romanticisation of
            school, the secret meetings to shout poetry and inspire others with
            words, and the honors society. Like the name suggests, there is a
            dark side to all of this, and Dead Poets Society is no different.
            This movie left me with a lot of inspiring quotes, and I
            particularly loved Neil.

          <h2>Merlin <br />by Julie Gardner</h2>
          <p id="merlin-text">
            For a TV show that was produced in 2008, I think the quality isn't
            too bad. I'm sure I would cringe looking back at it now, but for
            middle-school me this show was hilarious and magical. The fact that
            I still remember how this show ended speaks to my dissatisfaction
            with it though. I miss Arthur and Merlin's banter.

          <h2>Queen's Gambit <br />by Scott Frank</h2>
          <p id="qg-text">
            As someone who was in the chess club in elementary school, and have
            since casually played, Queen's Gambit was very fun watch. I adore
            Beth's awkwardness around people and how it all disappears the
            moment she sits in front of a chess board. Her ambition is
            admirable, and I found it really interesting how Netflix tied in
            drug addiction with chess.

          <h2>Attack on Titan <br />by Hajime Isayama</h2>
          <p id="aot-text">
            I feel like Attack on Titan is a given for anyone who watches anime.
            The plot is so beautifully written and connected, and there were so
            many plot twists that I didn't expect at all in the moment, but
            looking back was able to find the little hints everywhere. Every
            character has so much development - Attack on Titan is truly a work
            of art and is definitely one of my favorite shows of all time.

          <h2>Haikyu!! <br />by Haruichi Furadate</h2>
          <p id="haikyu-text">
            Haikyu!! was the first ever anime I watched, so it definitely holds
            a special place in my heart. Hinata and Kageyama's dynamic is so
            fun, and while there are intense moments in the show, it feels
            lighthearted as whole. Whenever I feel nostalgic, I pull up Haikyu!!
            My favorite character is Akaashi, he's such a calm character and he
            balances out Bokuto's energy.

          "Amazing direction by Wong Kar-wai and a film flooding to the brim with emotional pull and humanity, Fallen Angels is another great film in his repertoire. Shot with many effects and filming styles, the film literally portrays a moving city and those in it in such a surreal and exciting way. With the many references to Wong Kar-wai's Chungking Express(1994), this makes a wonderful companion piece to that particular film but thoroughly remains its own distinctively original story arc and characters. If you haven't checked out Wong Kar-wai yet or any of his films, Fallen Angels, Chungking Express (1994), In the Mood for Love (2000), or Happy Together(1997) are all released on Blu-ray, and you should rent or watch one to get a taste of his visual style. The first three have excellent Criterion Collection releases and Kino gives a solid job with Happy Together so if you like one you will likely find the others very intriguing and unique works as well!";
        hmcText.innerText =
          "Miyazaki emphasizes different narrative elements than most fantasy films of this kind (hence why the 'missing prince' plot twist is treated like an afterthought) but this isn't a cheap attempt to subvert expectations rather he's focusing on character growth at the expense of silly plot mechanics which makes his anti war plea more effective.";

          "He's (Professor Robert Keating) one of the few who sees the potential in them and encourages them to embrace life. 'Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary.'' These are the words that encapsulate this inspirational story about having a passion for and 'sucking the marrow out of...'' life. Professor Keating teaches in a very different and personal manner, quoting from such poets as Walt Whitman, Byron, Henry Thoreau and Robert Frost. He has a passion for what he teaches and shows a determination to instil that in his pupils.";

          "Cheesy, but it held my attention. I liked the main character especially. The special effects were a bit lame. But, Merlin, Gaius and Morgana made up for it. I continued to think to myself that the show is silly; a bit stupid. But, there I was watching it again. It really does hold the attention somehow. It's cute and kids seem to like it too. It might be a little violent for some children. But, they never show any gore in too much detail. I felt like it would be a show that children would enjoy while their parents could watch also without being utterly bored. I wanted a little more at the end. The servitude to lame a** Arthur by Merlin was tiresome. This show was nothing amazing but, as I said, peculiarly capturing my attention. Now, that being said, I especially liked the very end.";

Although the series had some moments the plot was relatively simple, I extremely love the end (in spite of the fact it was reasonably easy to predict it). And the actors were also exceptionally talented. I highly recommended this series, and I really considerer the people who have already watched it extremely lucky.";
        aotText.innerText =
          "Excellent continuation of the story. Really enjoyed the character development and story line. Tying up multiple narratives. The really fascinating part is the self hate experienced by Eldians due their heritage. The way Marlians exploit that self hate and use it to further their own political and military narrative. Eldian never ending self resentment is so similar to self resentment many young people feel today in the western world…. Fascinating series. Brutal at times, but quite engaging.";
